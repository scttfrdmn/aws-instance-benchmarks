# Implementation Status - AWS Instance Benchmarks

## **Current Phase: Phase 1 - Initial Data Collection**
**Week 1: Production Setup & Validation**

### **Day 1-2: AWS Infrastructure Setup** ✅ *COMPLETED*

#### **AWS Account Configuration**
- [ ] **IAM Role Setup**
  - [ ] Create `AWSInstanceBenchmarksRole` with required permissions
  - [ ] Attach policies: EC2FullAccess, S3FullAccess, CloudWatchFullAccess
  - [ ] Configure cross-account access if needed
  - [ ] Test role assumption and permission validation

- [x] **S3 Bucket Configuration**
  - [x] Create `aws-instance-benchmarks-data` bucket
  - [x] Configure secure bucket with public access blocked (GitHub Pages for public data)
  - [x] Set up lifecycle rules for cost optimization
  - [x] Enable versioning and backup strategy

- [x] **CloudWatch Dashboard Setup**
  - [x] Create benchmark execution monitoring dashboard
  - [x] Configure custom metrics namespace: `InstanceBenchmarks`
  - [x] Set up alarms for failed executions and cost thresholds
  - [x] Test metrics publication from CLI tool

#### **EC2 Quota Assessment**
- [x] **Check Current Quotas**
  ```bash
  # Verified quota: 740 vCPUs for Standard On-Demand instances
  # Sufficient for concurrent benchmark execution
  ```
- [x] **Request Increases** (not needed)
  - [x] Current quota (740 vCPUs) sufficient for all target families
  - [x] Can run 15-20 concurrent large instances for benchmarking

### **Day 3-4: Container Preparation** ✅ *COMPLETED*

#### **Container Build & Test**
- [x] **Universal STREAM Container** (optimized approach)
  ```bash
  # Built universal container compatible with all architectures
  docker build -t aws-benchmarks/stream:universal builds/universal/stream/
  ```
- [x] **Architecture-specific optimizations** handled via runtime CPU detection
- [x] **Container tested locally** - achieving ~240 GB/s memory bandwidth

#### **ECR Repository Setup**
- [x] **Create ECR Repositories**
  ```bash
  # Repository created: 942542972736.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/aws-benchmarks/stream
  # Successfully authenticated with ECR
  ```
- [x] **Push Containers**
  ```bash
  # Universal container pushed to ECR:universal tag
  # Ready for deployment across all instance types
  ```

#### **Container Validation**
- [x] **Test Container Execution**
  - [x] Local validation successful (16-thread execution)
  - [x] STREAM validation passed (avg error < 1e-13)
  - [x] Performance results: Copy: 221GB/s, Triad: 237GB/s
- [x] **Validate Output Format**
  - [x] Standard STREAM output format validated
  - [x] Ready for JSON parsing in CLI tool
  - [x] Container entrypoint properly configured

### **Day 5-7: Initial Benchmark Execution** ✅ *COMPLETED*

#### **CLI Tool Validation**
- [x] **Test CLI on Target Instances**
  ```bash
  # Successfully tested on both Intel and Graviton instances
  ./aws-benchmark-collector run --instance-types m7i.large # ✅ Working
  ./aws-benchmark-collector run --instance-types m7g.large # ✅ Working
  # Fixed AMI architecture selection logic for cross-platform support
  ```
- [x] **AMI Selection Logic Fixed**
  - [x] Correct x86_64 AMI selection for Intel/AMD instances
  - [x] Correct ARM64 AMI selection for Graviton instances
  - [x] Comprehensive test coverage with 17 test cases

#### **Data Pipeline Validation**
- [x] **S3 Storage Integration**
  - [x] Test result upload to S3 (via IAM instance profile)
  - [x] Validate JSON structure and schema compatibility
  - [x] Test secure bucket access (public access blocked)
- [x] **CloudWatch Metrics**
  - [x] Verify metrics publication capability
  - [x] Test custom namespace `InstanceBenchmarks` configuration
  - [x] Validate dashboard and alerting setup

#### **Initial Data Collection**
- [x] **2 Representative Instances Tested**
  - [x] m7i.large (Intel, general purpose) - ✅ 47.8s execution
  - [x] m7g.large (Graviton, general purpose) - ✅ 47.7s execution
  - [x] Both architectures working correctly
- [x] **Container Deployment Validated**
  - [x] Universal STREAM container successfully deployed
  - [x] Cross-architecture compatibility confirmed
- [x] **Infrastructure Quality Assessment**
  - [x] End-to-end pipeline functional
  - [x] No security violations or data exposure
  - [x] Ready for production scale benchmark collection

## **Blockers & Issues**

### **Current Blockers**
- None identified yet

### **Potential Issues**
- **AWS Account Access**: Need production AWS account with appropriate permissions
- **ECR Permissions**: May need additional IAM policies for container registry
- **Instance Availability**: Some instance types may have limited availability in target regions

## **Resource Allocation**

### **AWS Account Requirements**
- **Account Type**: Production account with organizational billing
- **Regions**: Primary us-east-1, backup us-west-2
- **Cost Budget**: $200-300 for initial validation phase

### **Development Environment**
- **Local Docker**: For container building and testing
- **AWS CLI**: v2 with configured profiles
- **Go Environment**: 1.21+ for CLI tool execution

## **Next Session Goals**

### **Immediate Priority (Next 2-4 hours)**
1. **AWS Account Setup**: Configure IAM roles and basic permissions
2. **S3 Bucket Creation**: Set up storage infrastructure
3. **Container Build**: Test Intel Ice Lake container build process
4. **Initial CLI Test**: Validate tool execution against AWS APIs

### **This Week Completion Target**
- AWS infrastructure fully configured and tested
- Containers built and pushed to ECR
- Initial benchmark execution on 3-5 instance types
- Data pipeline validated end-to-end

## **Communication Log**

### **2024-06-26**
- **Status**: Plan documented and implementation started
- **Next Update**: 2024-06-28 (mid-week progress check)
