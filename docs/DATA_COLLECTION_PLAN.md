# AWS Instance Benchmarks - Data Collection Execution Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**
Transition from infrastructure to production data collection for ComputeCompass integration

**Critical Path**: ComputeCompass requires benchmark data within 2-3 weeks for development dependency

## **Phase 1: Initial Data Collection (Weeks 1-2)**
*Priority: HIGH - ComputeCompass dependency*

### **Week 1: Production Setup & Validation**

#### **AWS Environment Setup**
- [ ] Configure production AWS account with appropriate IAM roles
- [ ] Set up S3 bucket for benchmark data storage (`aws-instance-benchmarks-data`)
- [ ] Configure CloudWatch dashboard for monitoring
- [ ] Test quota limits and request increases for target instance types

#### **Container Registry Setup**
- [ ] Build and push optimized STREAM containers to Amazon ECR
- [ ] Validate containers on 3 representative architectures (Intel, AMD, Graviton)
- [ ] Create automated build pipeline for container updates

#### **Initial Target Set** (15 instances for ComputeCompass MVP)
```
Memory-optimized: r7i.large, r7i.xlarge, r7a.large, r7g.large
Compute-optimized: c7i.large, c7i.xlarge, c7a.large, c7g.large  
General-purpose: m7i.large, m7i.xlarge, m7a.large, m7g.large
High-performance: hpc7a.medium, hpc7g.medium, c7gn.large
```

### **Week 2: Benchmark Execution**

#### **STREAM Benchmark Collection**
- [ ] Execute 10 runs per instance type for statistical validity
- [ ] Target: 150 total benchmark executions (15 instances Ã— 10 runs)
- [ ] Validate data quality and statistical confidence
- [ ] Store results in structured JSON format

#### **Data Validation & Processing**
- [ ] Run aggregation pipeline on collected data
- [ ] Generate initial performance rankings
- [ ] Validate cross-instance comparisons for reasonableness
- [ ] Create quality assessment reports

## **Phase 2: Public Data Release (Week 3)**
*Priority: HIGH - ComputeCompass integration ready*

### **Data Publication Infrastructure**

#### **GitHub Pages Setup**
- [ ] Create `docs/` directory with static site generator (Jekyll/Hugo)
- [ ] Design data browser interface for benchmark results
- [ ] Implement JSON API endpoints for programmatic access
- [ ] Add download links for raw data files

#### **API Documentation**
- [ ] Document JSON schema and data access patterns
- [ ] Create integration examples for ComputeCompass
- [ ] Provide client libraries/SDKs for common languages
- [ ] Set up automated API documentation generation

### **ComputeCompass Integration**

#### **Data Format Finalization**
- [ ] Coordinate with ComputeCompass team on required data structure
- [ ] Implement caching strategy for performance (1-hour cache as specified)
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms for data unavailability
- [ ] Test integration with ComputeCompass development environment

## **Phase 3: Automation & Scaling (Weeks 4-5)**
*Priority: MEDIUM - Sustainable operations*

### **Automated Collection Pipeline**

#### **GitHub Actions Workflow**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/benchmark-collection.yml
name: Weekly Benchmark Collection
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Every Monday at 2 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:     # Manual trigger
```

#### **Monitoring & Alerting**
- [ ] CloudWatch alarms for failed benchmark runs
- [ ] Cost monitoring and budget alerts
- [ ] Data quality validation checks
- [ ] Automated issue creation for failures

### **Extended Instance Coverage**

#### **Expand to 50+ Instance Types**
- [ ] Add remaining popular families (x2gd, i4i, m6i, c6i, r6i)
- [ ] Include specialized instances (inf2, trn1) with custom benchmarks
- [ ] Multi-region validation (us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1)

## **Phase 4: Community Platform (Week 6)**
*Priority: MEDIUM - Long-term sustainability*

### **Community Infrastructure**

#### **Contribution Framework**
- [ ] GitHub issue templates for benchmark requests
- [ ] Pull request workflows for community data submissions
- [ ] Validation pipeline for external contributions
- [ ] Contributor guidelines and recognition system

#### **Data Quality System**
- [ ] Automated outlier detection across submissions
- [ ] Peer review process for unusual results
- [ ] Statistical confidence scoring for all data
- [ ] Version control for benchmark methodologies

## **Phase 5: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-8)**
*Priority: LOW - Value-added capabilities*

### **HPL/LINPACK Integration**

#### **Computational Benchmarks**
- [ ] Build HPL containers for computational performance
- [ ] Execute GFLOPS measurements on compute-optimized instances
- [ ] Integrate with existing analysis pipeline

### **Cost Analysis Integration**

#### **Price-Performance Database**
- [ ] Integrate AWS Pricing API for real-time cost data
- [ ] Calculate price/performance ratios automatically
- [ ] Track spot pricing patterns and availability
- [ ] Generate cost optimization recommendations

## **Success Metrics & Milestones**

### **Week 2 Milestone: ComputeCompass Ready**

- âœ… JSON API accessible via GitHub Raw URLs
- âœ… Data format validated with ComputeCompass integration

### **Week 3 Milestone: Public Launch**
- âœ… Public website with data browser
- âœ… Documentation and integration guides
- âœ… Community contribution processes

### **Week 6 Milestone: Sustainable Operations**
- âœ… Automated weekly benchmark collection
- âœ… 50+ instance types with multi-region validation
- âœ… Community platform with active contributions

## **Resource Requirements**

### **AWS Costs** (Estimated)
- **Compute**: $500-1000/month (benchmark execution)
- **Storage**: $50/month (S3 data storage)
- **Monitoring**: $25/month (CloudWatch metrics)

### **Development Time**
- **Phase 1-2**: 60-80 hours (critical path for ComputeCompass)
- **Phase 3-4**: 40-60 hours (automation and community)
- **Phase 5**: 30-40 hours (advanced features)

## **Risk Mitigation**

### **Technical Risks**
- **AWS Quota Limits**: Request increases early, have backup regions
- **Benchmark Failures**: Implement retry logic and error recovery
- **Data Quality**: Multiple validation layers and statistical checks

### **Timeline Risks**
- **ComputeCompass Dependency**: Prioritize Phase 1-2 completion
- **AWS Setup Delays**: Parallelize infrastructure and development work
- **Container Issues**: Test on multiple architectures early

## **Immediate Next Actions** (This Week)

### **Day 1-2: AWS Infrastructure Setup**
1. Configure production AWS account with IAM roles
2. Set up S3 bucket and CloudWatch monitoring
3. Test EC2 quota limits for target instance types

### **Day 3-4: Container Preparation**
1. Build and test STREAM containers on representative architectures
2. Push containers to Amazon ECR
3. Validate container execution on different instance families

### **Day 5-7: Initial Benchmark Execution**
1. Execute benchmark runs on 5 representative instances
2. Validate data collection and storage pipeline
3. Test aggregation and analysis functionality

### **Week 2: Full Data Collection**
1. Execute complete benchmark suite on 15-instance target set
2. Generate initial performance rankings and analysis
3. Prepare data format for ComputeCompass integration

## **Dependencies & Coordination**

### **ComputeCompass Integration Requirements**
- **Data Format**: JSON structure compatible with existing caching strategy  
- **Access Method**: GitHub Raw URLs with 1-hour cache TTL (data published via GitHub Actions from secure S3)
- **Security**: S3 bucket remains private, public access via GitHub Pages only
- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation when benchmark data unavailable
- **Update Frequency**: Weekly data refresh cycle

### **AWS Account Requirements**
- **EC2 Service Quotas**: Sufficient limits for simultaneous instance launches
- **IAM Permissions**: Full EC2, S3, and CloudWatch access
- **Cost Management**: Budget alerts and spending monitoring
- **Security**: Proper key management and access controls

## **Communication Plan**

### **Weekly Progress Reports**
- **Monday**: Week planning and resource allocation
- **Wednesday**: Mid-week progress check and issue resolution
- **Friday**: Week completion status and next week preparation

### **Stakeholder Updates**
- **ComputeCompass Team**: Bi-weekly integration status
- **Community**: Monthly progress updates via GitHub discussions
- **AWS Account Owner**: Weekly cost and quota status
