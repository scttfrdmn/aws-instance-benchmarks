## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps Implementation Guide

### **Immediate Next Task: STREAM Benchmark Implementation**

#### **Step 1: Container Enhancement (Week 1)**

```bash
# Create enhanced STREAM benchmark containers
mkdir -p tools/benchmarks/stream
```

**Required Files:**
- `tools/benchmarks/stream/Dockerfile`: Enhanced STREAM container

- `tools/benchmarks/stream/result-parser.py`: Result extraction utility

**Container Requirements:**
- NUMA-aware STREAM execution
- Multiple run capability with statistical analysis
- JSON result output for automated processing
- Architecture-specific optimization validation

#### **Step 2: Execution Integration (Week 2)**

**Enhance AWS Orchestrator:**

#### **Step 3: Validation & Testing (Week 3)**

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for benchmark execution logic
- Integration tests with real AWS instances
- Performance validation against known baselines
- Error handling validation for edge cases

### **Development Priorities**

#### **Critical Path Items**
1. **STREAM container implementation** - Blocking all benchmark execution
2. **Result collection pipeline** - Required for data persistence
3. **S3 integration** - Needed for scalable result storage
4. **Statistical validation** - Essential for data quality

#### **Dependencies**
- AWS infrastructure setup must be complete before benchmark execution
- Container registry access required for image distribution
- S3 bucket creation needed for result storage
- IAM permissions must include S3 and CloudWatch access

### **Technical Debt & Improvements**

#### **Current Technical Debt**

### **Resource Requirements**

#### **Development Resources**
- **Developer Time**: 2-3 weeks for Phase 2 completion
- **AWS Costs**: $200-500 for testing across instance types
- **Container Registry**: ECR Public (free tier sufficient)
- **Storage**: S3 costs for result data (~$10-50/month initially)

#### **Infrastructure Requirements**
- AWS account with appropriate service limits
- Container registry access (ECR Public recommended)
- S3 bucket for result storage with lifecycle policies
- CloudWatch dashboards for monitoring

### **Risk Mitigation**

#### **Technical Risks**
- **AWS quota limitations**: Mitigated by quota validation and skip mechanisms
- **Container build failures**: Addressed by comprehensive testing and fallbacks
- **Result data corruption**: Prevented by JSON schema validation
- **Performance variability**: Handled by multiple runs and statistical analysis

#### **Operational Risks**
- **Cost overruns**: Controlled by automatic instance termination
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Addressed by regular dependency updates
